    <p id ="email">Hello? 
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone home?
Come on now;
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again.
Relax,
I'll need some information first-
Just the basic facts-
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child, I had a fever;
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again;
I can't explain, you would not understand.
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb
